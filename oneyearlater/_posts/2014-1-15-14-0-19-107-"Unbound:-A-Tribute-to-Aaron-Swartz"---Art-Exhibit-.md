Unbound is a visual sociopolitical manifestation of Aaron's journey with activism. This art exhibit was conceived to honor Aaronâ€™s lifelong pursuit of justice and to amplify his contributions to society. The exhibit provides space to artists and activists who, like Aaron, challenge the status quo, disrupt unjust systems, give voice to the voiceless and build movements for justice and equity. Aaron used technology as a tool for positive social transformation and progress. Artists use their art.

To view the exhibit:
