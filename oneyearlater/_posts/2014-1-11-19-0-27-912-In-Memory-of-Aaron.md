I am sorry you left this world way to soon! But your spirit & heart touched millions of people around the world! Your light keeps shining on! Your dream to liberate knowledge that every one should be able to access. Rich or poor.  Not just the wealthy but for all people. You have passed your lit torch to millions of people. Who will continue to fight for internet freedom for all!!! I know your spirit lives on !!
