I didn't have to know Aaron personally to feel his impact.

In fact, Aaron was one of those rare individuals that had what I call "natural impact" on a society.  That is, you could feel his impact, even if you didn't know a thing about him or what he did.

Other people who had this "natural impact" were Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and Thoreau... among other rare individuals.

Aaron Swartz, know this, for me... your "natural impact" gave me permission to think more deeply, act more swiftly, and more.

Thank you Aaron, you are still missed.
