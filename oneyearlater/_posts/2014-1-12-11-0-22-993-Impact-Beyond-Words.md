In life, I knew Aaron as a friend of friends, a thinker whose questions would challenge and inspire all of us who work for a fairer world. 

Since Aaron died, I've seen him everywhere.

On the cover of street magazines in Greece, in the speeches of campaigners in Britain, on t-shirts in America.

I've seen him inspire a movement, not of hackers and professionals, but of everyday people standing up for what's right.

And, I've seen the remarkable bravery and commitment of Taren and Aaron's family, ensuring that his legacy lives on.
