I didn't know much about Aaron Swartz before news of his death spread across the internet but as I read the story of this remarkable person, I couldn't help but cry. I didn't know Aaron but I knew the world had lost a guiding light leading the way to a future in which knowledge is available to anyone with the will to seek it. Humanity would suffer simply because the established powers wanted to make an example of someone who dared challenge the status quo. I'm sure many others were crying with me at that very moment, holding onto the same thought.

We must continue to demonstrate that the actions of those who wish to suppress freedom have backfired. We must show them that Aaron Swartz wasn't just some young punk who broke the law. They are in the wrong but Aaron knew that all along and so do we.
