A year ago I barely knew about your actions, but I knew who you were. I have felt that struggle my entire life and like you most of the time I felt the almost automatic rejection for the simple fact of being younger, your dead reminded me how vulnerable I am in this world and most importantly, how my actions should be made public and shared just in the sad case I am not that strong anymore. You inspired a new open life.

You are still alive.
