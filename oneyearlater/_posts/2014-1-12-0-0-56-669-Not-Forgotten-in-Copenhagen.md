For a long time after Aaron died, my background picture on my computer was a lovely image of him. I wanted to remember his courage and his struggle. It may seem a bit silly, but simultaneously it is also very appropriate platform. The first thing I see before I use the internet. Long live his memory, and may his ideas and opinions inspire many others. He is not forgotten in Copenhagen.
