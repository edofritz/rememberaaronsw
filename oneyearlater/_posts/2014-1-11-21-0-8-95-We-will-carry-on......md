Thank you brother for your brilliance, your struggle and your sacrifice. Know that your efforts and your life were not in vain. The rest of the world owes you a debt of gratitude and we will carry on what you began. Your death awakened millions of warriors to the struggle, we go now to carry out that mission, carrying you in our hearts forever...........Salini ![We will carry on.....](http://intentionradio.com/emerging-matrix/)
