Aaron is someone I never met, but his activism inspired many Australians like me trying to reform copyright laws which are out of date, inflexible, unnecessarily complex, imbalanced and virtually blind to digital communications technology.  He inspired those of us working to resist the further erosion of internet freedoms to creatively persist in this work.  In his memory I rededicate myself to this goal. Aaron's impact remains, his work continues.
