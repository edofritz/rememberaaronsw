I was inspired by your courage in standing up to freedom of access to our shared heritage - the cultural products of shared human effort.

In this vein, I would like to say that your words and deeds have left a lasting impact in many people, myself included.

I am convinced that through time, the fight to grant universal, free access to all human knowledge will be won, thereby vindicating your life's work and showing that the government's effort to constrain freedom were futile.

I stand with you, Mr. Swartz.
Your memory will live on.
