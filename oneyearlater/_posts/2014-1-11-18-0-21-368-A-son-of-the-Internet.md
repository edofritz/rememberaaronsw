Aaron, you was one of those who want that the knowledge and the culture could be share by all humans.

I am not an american, but as you, I am an internaut. Your way was the good, but it was a lot of traps. What it called "justice" had killed you, but it was just intolerance. But, intolerance mans are not eternal, while you will be in the eternity of our memories.

We will never forget you. And we will fight in order that your work wasn't in vain.

You are a real son of the Internet and a son of the Humanity.
